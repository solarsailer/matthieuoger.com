I am Matthieu Oger, a _product manager_, _developer_ and _designer_ from France.

I co-founded [Pixelnest Studio][pixelnest] in February 2014 with [Damien Mayance][dmayance]. We are crafting some delightful apps, websites and games. Our most famous product is [Steredenn](http://steredenn.pixelnest.io) — an award-winning shmup/roguelike.

This place is a way to express my thoughts and opinions on a broad range of subjects, including technology, design, photography and development.

These opinions are mine, not those of my company.

## About this blog

I built this blog with [Gatsby][gatsby]. The code and design are purely mine, except for some icons (Twitter, GitHub, Dribbble and Instagram). These are made by Daniel Bruce, from his [Entypo][entypo] set.

The layout is particularly optimized for mobiles and high density screens (read: retina displays).
