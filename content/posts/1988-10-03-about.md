I am Matthieu Oger, a _product manager_, _developer_ and _designer_ from France.

I co-founded [Pixelnest Studio][pixelnest] in February 2014 with [Damien Mayance][dmayance]. We crafted some delightful apps, websites and games. Our most famous product is [Steredenn](http://steredenn.pixelnest.io) — an award-winning shmup/roguelike. We decided to put the company in hibernation at the end of 2018. [_It was time to move on._](https://pixelnest.io/2018/11/the-beginning-and-the-end/)

**I'm now focusing solely on product management, leading teams design and build better softwares.**

I recently worked for [Shift Technology](https://www.shift-technology.com), a Parisian startup using AI to solve complex automation problems in the insurance industry. My current company is [The Explorers](https://theexplorers.com), another Parisian startup which is creating an inventory of the planet in super high definition — _”know better to protect better”_.

This place is a way to express my thoughts and opinions on a broad range of subjects, including technology, design, photography and development.

These opinions are mine, not those of my companies.

## About this blog

I built this blog with [Gatsby][gatsby]. The code and design are purely mine, except for some icons (Twitter, GitHub, Dribbble and Instagram). These are made by Daniel Bruce, from his [Entypo][entypo] set.

The layout is particularly optimized for mobiles and high density screens (read: retina displays).
