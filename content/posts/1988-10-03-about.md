I am Matthieu Oger, a developer and designer working for [Pixelnest][pixelnest], a studio that I co-founded with [Damien Mayance][dmayance]. We are crafting some delightful games and apps, like [Steredenn](http://steredenn.pixelnest.io).

This place is a way to express my thoughts and opinions on a broad range of subjects, including technology, design and development.

These opinions are mine, not those of my company.

## About this blog

I built this blog with [Jekyll][jekyll] and I host it on [Github Pages][github]. The code and design are purely mine, except for the beautiful icons created by Daniel Bruce — [Entypo][entypo].

The layout is particularly optimized for mobiles and high density screens (read: retina displays).

If you want to follow me with your favorite feed reader, use this [feed][rss]. You can also check it via twitter by following [@solarsailerfeed](http://twitter.com/solarsailerfeed).
