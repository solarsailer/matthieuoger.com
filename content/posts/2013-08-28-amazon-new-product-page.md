[Interesting article on Bokardo](http://bokardo.com/archives/a-thought-on-amazons-new-product-page-design/) about the amazon's "new" product page:

> If Amazon were to make a big change, like for example do some actual visual design so everything didn’t have the same visual weight, the mere shock of the change would probably send their revenue downward, at least initially. People dislike change because change is work. They have to figure out what changed, adapt to it, relearn the UI, and still try to get their job done (they one they used to know how to do). **So the next time you hear “People hate change” think to yourself “People don’t hate change. They hate the work of change”.**

(emphasis mine)
