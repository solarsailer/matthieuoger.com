Exactly my feeling.

I used to read my feeds in one **beautiful** app, whatever the device I was using (Reeder - iPhone, iPad, Mac). Bonus: the sync service (Google Reader) was almost flawless.

Now, we have a myriad of alternatives, and I can't find one that seems as good as Google Reader was â€” _and_ working with each version of Reeder.

The worst thing in this mess is that a fair amount of the old Google Reader users would have gladly paid for it - the adoption of Feedbin or FeedWrangler clearly demonstrates that.
