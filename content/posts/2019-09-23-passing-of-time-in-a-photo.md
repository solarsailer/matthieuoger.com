Einstein described time as a fabric. Think of the surface of a trampoline: it warps and stretches with gravity.

I see time as a fabric as well, except I take that fabric and flatten it, compress it into a single plane. One of the unique aspects of this work is also, if you look at all my pictures, the time vector changes: sometimes I'll go left to right, sometimes front to back, up or down, even diagonally. I am exploring the space-time continuum within a two-dimensional still photograph.

[…] I build a photograph based on time. […]

I'm compressing the day and night as I saw it, creating a unique harmony between these two very discordant worlds.

[…] Time is this extraordinary thing that we never can really wrap our heads around. But in a very unique and special way, I believe these photographs begin to put a face on time. They embody a new metaphysical visual reality. […]

**I realised that Day to Night is really a new way of seeing.**

I watched over 15 hours all these people not even look at Sacré-Coeur. They were more interested in using it as a backdrop. They would walk up, take a picture, and then walk away. And I found this to be an absolutely extraordinary example, a powerful disconnect between what we think the human experience is versus what the human experience is evolving into. _The act of sharing has suddenly become more important than the experience itself._

[Near a watering hole in the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania] What I witnessed was unimaginable. Frankly, it was biblical. We saw, for 26 hours, all these competitive species share a single resource called water. The same resource that humanity is supposed to have wars over during the next 50 years. The animals never even grunted at each other. _They seem to understand something that we humans don't._ That this precious resource called water is something we all have **to share**.
