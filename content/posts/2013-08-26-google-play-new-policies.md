title: Google Play new policies

[Google’s New Policies: Good for Users, Great for Android Developers and the Ecosystem](http://blog.inner-active.com/2013/08/googles-new-policies-good-for-users-great-for-android-developers-and-the-ecosystem/):

> So what does all this mean? It means that Google understands that while open is great, at the end of the day, users would rather have a superior experience both in terms of Google Play as a whole, and apps behavior in particular.

I am really thrilled by the changes, but I can't help smiling. Android might be "open", Google is definitely not.

This makes me wonder…

* Android was the alternative to iOS because of the lack of policies (at least, by the developers). Google Play is now a lot more similar to the App Store. It is not as strict though.
* Will Google remove the abusive apps retroactively?
* China? Google was already out, but this will make the situation worse.

Anyways, the chasm between Play (Google's Android) and Android is getting wider every day.

**Update**: I couldn't agree more with [John Moltz](http://verynicewebsite.net/2013/08/open-always-loses/)...

> I think it’s kind of amusing how quickly the narrative has changed from “Yay, open!” to “I, for one, welcome our closed overlords.”
