title: Is the new Apple iOS 7 look an improvement?

[David Cole on Quora](http://www.quora.com/iOS-7/Is-the-new-Apple-iOS-7-look-an-improvement/answer/David-Cole):

> I have a different perspective than most of the other answerers here. I don't think the interesting components of iOS 7 are found in the icons or the color or the type â€” those are relatively self-contained and thus easy to change and evolve. I think the most interesting changes, and the best changes, run much deeper than that, and yet they're intrinsically linked to the "look" of it.

One of the best thoughts that I have read about iOS 7.
