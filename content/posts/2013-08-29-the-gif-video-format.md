> Animated GIF, despite having awful compression and terrible quality, is still more useful on the web than any other video format.

> In 2013 people still routinely convert YouTube clips to GIF (producing postage-stamp-sized dithered-to-death desaturated blobs that use more bandwidth than a full HD video), because there's still no better way to share a short movie clip on the web.

Sad. Read the whole thing.
