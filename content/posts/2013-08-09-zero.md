> Everyone works differently. The trick is finding out how you work best. For me, I tend to take an OCD approach to emptying things. I keep a clean desktop: under three icons at a time, preferably. It made sense to use my desktop as a kind of bucket I needed to empty: it's always there, and I can put short, actionable items there because that visually disturbs me enough to want to clean it off (and do the action).

I have a similar mindset. I hate having stuffs in front of me:

- I close any app I don't use now
- I keep my tabs at a minimum
- I empty my mail inbox as much as I can
- I prune my RSS and Twitter feeds
- I clean my OS desktop

A sort of minimalism? Probably.
