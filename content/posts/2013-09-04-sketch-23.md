title: Sketch 2.3
---

The biggest new yesterday was not that Microsoft bought Nokia. In fact, it was written on the wall for more than 2 years. And others have blogged [better](http://stratechery.com/2013/the-deal-that-makes-no-sense/) [things](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2013/9/3/microsoft-and-nokia) than I could.

No, [it was the release of Sketch 2.3](http://bohemiancoding.tumblr.com/post/60070936484/sketch-2-3).

There's a lot of things that I like in this new version:

* Speed. **It is incomparable**.
* PDF import. I was looking for that for a long time.
* Sketch Mirror.

The only downside of this release is when I work with text. It doesn't feel smooth.

Such an awesome piece of software.
