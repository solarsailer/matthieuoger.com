[Rene Ritchie](http://www.imore.com/wheres-bigger-iphone):

> When a company like Apple goes to all the trouble of building a **physics** and **particle engine** to support their interface, when they **objectify** it and **gamify** it and **make it a dynamic, living thing**, it opens up a lot of potential. When you add **Text Kit** to mix, and the **design language** in general, and when you see what it all looks and feels like on an iPad mini, then the possibilities for a bigger iPhone next year become infinitely more exciting.

Good recap of the real changes brought by iOS 7.
