[Wired](http://www.wired.com/design/2013/08/a-lego-set-with-no-instructions-for-budding-architects/):

> Architecture Studio, a new set from Lego, comes with 1,210 white and translucent bricks. More notable is what it lacks: namely, instructions for any single thing youâ€™re supposed to build with it. Instead, the kit is accompanied by a thick, 277-page guidebook filled with architectural concepts and building techniques alongside real world insights from prominent architecture studios from around the globe.

It's a wonderful idea.
