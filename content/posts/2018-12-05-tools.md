From “[Blood, Sweat and Pixels][book]” (written by [Jason Schreier][twitter]):

> The biggest differentiator between a studio that creates a really high-quality _[product]_ and a studio that doesn't isn't the quality of the team.
>
> **It's their dev tools.**
>
> If you can take fifty shots on goal, and you're a pretty shitty hockey player, and I can only take three shots on goal and I'm Wayne Gretzky, you're probably going to do better.
>
> **That's what tool are. It's how fast can you iterate**, how stable are they, how robust are they, how easy it is as a nontechnical artist to move a thing.
