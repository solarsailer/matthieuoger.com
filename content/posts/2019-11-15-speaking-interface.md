[Erik D. Kennedy](https://learnui.design/blog/4-rules-intuitive-ux.html):

> Now, my clients weren’t _this_ bad, but look  —  you don’t need to be Bret Victor to understand that if you can only select ONE thing from a list, you need RADIO BUTTONS, not checkboxes. To understand _that_, you just need to be able to _**speak interface**_. And that’s the craziest thing to me. Interface fluency is something _anyone_ can achieve. You don’t need college, you don’t need Lambda school, yadda yadda.

> Frankly, you just need the **presence of mind** to (A) pause every single time you’re confused or frustrated by some app, (B) verbalize _what_ about the interface makes you confused/frustrated/etc., and then (C) figure out how you could avoid that specific snafu in your own designs.

A million times, **yes**.
