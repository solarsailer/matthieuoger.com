> [About building software] When I see people **doing very visible and consequential actions**, I find myself thinking that they are doing a “hero shot” and it must mean that they **got “out of position” for the past few shots** and now the **only option that they have left is unsatisfying** but there’s no other choice.

It's like the "sysadmin paradox".[^1]

A great sysadmin is someone who seems to do almost nothing: the stack is functioning as expected, there's no outage (or really short ones), the software is updated, developers are autonomous, and all the processes and deployements are automated and painless[^2]. This sysadmin is never too busy, answers quickly and acts fast. There's nothing extraordinary happening: it just… works. Almost too easy?

A bad sysadmin will always be on the rush. Though… they do _look_ busy.[^3]


[^1]: Actually, this applies to many jobs, but I find it egregiously visible on support ones.

[^3]: Don't get me wrong — they are some times and/or jobs where you have no other choice than working a lot. _It's the attitude that matters._
