A wonderful new game (available on iOS and soon on Android). It reminds me of [Fez](http://fezgame.com/), [Journey](http://thatgamecompany.com/games/journey/) and [Sworcery](http://www.swordandsworcery.com/), but still with its own unique atmosphere and mechanics.

The game is short, reasonably priced (4$) and stunning. Sounds are just perfect.

I'm pretty sure that this game is going to generalize [low-poly graphics](http://imgur.com/a/knj1I#8) in indie games.
