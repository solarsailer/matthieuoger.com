It's a problem I see in many products and videogames. A videogame can have a fantastic retention score, but it does not make it _fun_.

I'm not against analytics (quite the contrary, if done respectfully), but it should not be your main driver. It should be a source of advices and confirmation to qualitative analysis, insights and/or gut feelings. **It should be secondary to the experience itself.**

Sometimes, you should do something because it makes your product [better and more pleasant][delight], not because it checks another item on an imaginary features checklist or because it pleases one specific client.
