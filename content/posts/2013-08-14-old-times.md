I didn't find enough time to create this blog over the last years. However, during this timespan, I read **a lot** of great articles.

I'm going to link some of them from time to time. After all, I also created this blog to be a sort of personal archive of what I liked, with my impressions.

I already did that once, with this article: [Quote â€” "Life is too short to stare at ugly graphs. And yes, you should feel bad."](https://matthieuoger.com/2013/08/life-too-short-ugly-graphs/).
