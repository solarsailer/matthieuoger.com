title: solar sailer — About

I am Matthieu Oger, a developer and designer working for [Pixelnest][pixelnest], a studio that I co-founded with [Damien Mayance][dmayance]. We are crafting some delightful games and apps that will be available soon.

This place is a way to express my thoughts and opinions on a broad range of subjects, including technology, design and development.

These opinions are mine, not those of my company.

## About this blog

I built this blog with [Jekyll][jekyll] and I host it on [Github Pages][github]. The code and design are purely mine, except for the beautiful icons created by Daniel Bruce — [Entypo][entypo].

The layout is particularly optimized for mobiles and high density screens (read: retina displays).
