[Great article](http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2013/08/29/nintendo/) (as usual) by Lukas Mathis:

> But the 2DS just isn’t made for people like me. That doesn’t mean it’s going to fail. That doesn’t mean it’s a bad product. It just means it’s not for me.

> And this, finally, brings all of this back to the topic of design. If you want to design a successful product, don’t design a product that’s only good for people like you, because most people aren’t like you.

Do not miss the footnotes either.
