title: Matt Thorson on Towerfall, Ouya, game design and pricing
---

The [full interview](http://www.polygon.com/2013/7/19/4535012/towerfall-ouya-matt-thorson-multiplayer-competitive-fighting-games) is really great:

> "I personally don't think the Ouya's audience is big enough to support mobile pricing," he added. "All the arguments towards pricing lower were to cater to people's expectations, and I believe TowerFall is worth $15 if you have people to play with." [â€¦]

> "On an iPhone, you can charge a dollar and potentially make it back because the audience is gigantic. But there aren't enough Ouyas out there yet."

However, I must confess that I'm a bit surprised that only 2.000 copies have been sold. Even at $15 each.
