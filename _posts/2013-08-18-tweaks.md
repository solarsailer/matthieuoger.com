title: Little tweaks
---

I just made some modifications to the blog. A bigger font, a _whiter_ background and un-italicized quotations. I also reduced the size of the page by 300px. I've always felt that the page was way too large.

I think that these little tweaks will make the reading experience more enjoyable.
