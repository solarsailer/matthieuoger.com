title: Windows Phone and WinRT
---

From [Windows Phone or Windows RT?](http://winsupersite.com/windows-phone/windows-phone-or-windows-rt):

> Microsoft already has a mobile platform with a thriving ecosystem. It’s called Windows Phone, and I think it makes a far better choice for general purpose tablets than does Windows RT.

I used to have a Nokia Windows Phone, that I loved. The experience was pretty good, except for the lack of apps.[^1]

I created some Windows Phone 7 applications (notably [Culturez-Vous][CV] with Damien Mayance). I also developed a WinRT library for my daily work then — before Pixelnest.

I had a Windows 8 and a WinRT device (Surface) at my workplace these days, and it was horrible. The experience was bad — the OS was a schizophrenic beast, always switching between the classic desktop and the Metro environment, with no apps. It was slow, unrefined, confusing. [The font rendering was horrid][image].

When the announcement of WinRT became public, I wondered why Microsoft did not leverage its Windows Phone OS, instead of starting from scratch with Windows 8. A tablet with Windows Phone would have been far better than a tablet with the fail that is WinRT/Windows 8.


[^1]: To be fair, however, even then I thought that iOS was a superior OS. But I like to try a new OS to discover what works and not, and to make my own opinion.<br /><br />Windows Phone lacked some polish but was rock solid, especially when compared to Android. At least, the Lumia was a supercharged feature phone with a browser and a decent keyboard.
